# Food Recipes Application  

A simple Food recipe fetching application following MVVM Architecture.

It is utilising:

1. Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites.

2. Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object.

3. Room : Save meals in local database.

4. MVVM & LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes.

5. Coroutines : do some code in the background.
6. View binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that.
7. Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
